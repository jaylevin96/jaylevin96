## Welcome!!

My name is Jay Levin. I am a new full stack software engineer that has a strong proficiency in React/Redux, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. I have over three years of previous consulting experience where I've developed a strong understanding of Agile methodologies and SLDC. As a recent graduate of a software engineering bootcamp focused on web development, I am actively honing these skills and looking for new opportunities where I can leverage my previous consulting experience and new technical skills.
